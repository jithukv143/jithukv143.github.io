									<p>I am Currently pursuing an MS in Cybersecurity at Pace University, with an expected graduation, in
										July 2025. In both my academic
										studies and professional experiences, I've developed a strong grasp of cybersecurity principles and
										data analysis, which perfectly aligns with the requirements of the cybersecurity role, making me a
										strong fit for the role.
										During my time as a Cybersecurity Intern at Tracelay Networks, I focused on enhancing system
										security using advanced tools such as Microsoft EDR, MITRE, Att&CK Navigator, ThreatQ, and
										ExtraHop. This experience provided me with the skills to protect sensitive data and mitigate
										cyberattack risks. While working at Cognizant, I conducted unit testing, integrated code with AWS
										and CI/CD, resolved numerous coding issues to ensure program accuracy, and completed over 20
										user stories within three months. My daily direct interactions with clients played a significant role in
										achieving a client satisfaction rate of over 95%.
										I also applied my data analysis skills in an academic project involving a cloud-based honeypot with
										SSH, which deepened my understanding of proactive threat detection and incident response.
										Through my coursework and hands-on experience, notably the Penetration Testing Project with
										Metasploit, I've honed my ability to identify cyber threats and vulnerabilities. This unique skill set
										equips me to analyze security risks and make data-driven decisions to optimize cybersecurity
										measures within the Analyst Program.
										My cybersecurity expertise is further validated by my certifications, including CompTIA Security+,
										CASP, and CYSA+. My strong passion for cybersecurity aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. I
										look forward to the opportunity to contribute. Thank you for being here and going through my
										profile.</p>
