									<p>I'm pursuing an MS in Cybersecurity at Pace University with a GPA of 4, graduating in July 2025. My academic and
										 professional experiences have given me a strong foundation in cybersecurity.</p>
										
										<p>
											During my recent summer internship at Motorola Solutions, I gained hands-on experience in deploying cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions, 
											focusing on SIEM systems and security testing. This role allowed me to contribute to rapid response strategies and implement robust defenses against cyber threats
										</p>

										 <p>As a Cybersecurity Intern at Tracelay Networks, I used advanced tools like Microsoft EDR, MITRE, Att&CK Navigator, ThreatQ,
										 and ExtraHop to enhance system security. At Cognizant, I achieved a client satisfaction rate of over 95% by conducting unit
										  testing and integrating code with AWS.</p>
										
										  <p>My academic background includes a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. Beyond my technical skills, 
											I have been actively involved in the cybersecurity community. Volunteering with ISACA and (ISC)Â² and participating in events like the IBM Security Summit and the 
											Metro Joint Cybersecurity Summit, NYC 2023, have enriched my understanding of industry trends and reinforced my commitment to continuous learning. </p>
										
										  <p>My certifications, such as CompTIA Security+, CASP, and CYSA+, validate my cybersecurity expertise and My work on projects like malware analysis, reverse engineering,
											 and penetration testing has further solidified my technical skills and my passion for protecting digital assets
										 I'm passionate about cybersecurity and look forward to contributing to your team. Thank you for reviewing my profile.</p>
